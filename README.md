 Domain & Workload Analysis Report
1. Module: Voice-to-Text for Sesotho
Domain Analysis (The "Why")
In Lesotho, the primary language is Sesotho. While many are bilingual, digital literacy and text-based interfaces can still be a barrier, especially for older populations or those with limited formal education. A reliable voice-to-text module operating in Sesotho would be a game-changer. It enables:

Financial Inclusion: Users could interact with mobile money services like M-Pesa by voice, checking balances or making transactions without navigating complex menus.

Access to Information: Requesting government service information, local weather forecasts for farming, or bus schedules becomes accessible to everyone.

Communication: Sending SMS or WhatsApp messages by dictating them in Sesotho removes the barrier of typing on a small keyboard.

This module directly addresses the challenge of digital inclusion by making technology conform to the user's natural language and mode of communication.

Workload Requirements (The "How")
The process of converting speech to text can be broken down into two main computational stages:

Feature Extraction: This stage transforms raw audio waves into a compact, useful representation. The most common method is calculating Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).

Input: A stream of 16-bit audio samples.

Core Operations:

Fast Fourier Transform (FFT): This algorithm analyzes small windows of audio to see which frequencies are present. Computationally, it's a sequence of "butterfly" operations, each of which is essentially a complex multiply-accumulate. This is MAC-intensive.

Mel Filterbank: This involves a matrix-vector multiplication to group the FFT results into bands that mimic human hearing. This is another purely MAC-intensive task.

Logarithm & DCT: Further mathematical transforms that are less intensive but still involve vector arithmetic.

Acoustic Model (Pattern Matching): This stage compares the extracted features (the MFCC vectors) to a pre-trained dictionary of Sesotho sounds (phonemes).

Input: A sequence of MFCC vectors.

Core Operations: For a simple, on-device model, this involves calculating the "distance" between the input vector and the dictionary vectors. This is a dot product or Euclidean distance calculation, which boils down to a sequence of subtractions, multiplications, and additions. Again, a MAC-heavy workload.

Conclusion: The workload is dominated by vector arithmetic, specifically multiply-accumulate operations on streams of 16-bit data.

2. Module: Agricultural Image Analysis (Maize Disease)
Domain Analysis (The "Why")
Maize (poone in Sesotho) is a staple food and a primary source of income for a vast majority of rural households in Lesotho. Crop yields are threatened by diseases like Maize Streak Virus and Grey Leaf Spot. For a small-scale farmer, identifying these diseases early is the difference between a successful harvest and financial ruin. This module acts as a "pocket agronomist," using the phone's camera to provide an initial diagnosis.

Workload Requirements (The "How")
The process involves analyzing a photo of a maize leaf to find tell-tale signs of disease.

Image Preprocessing:

Input: A color image (e.g., 24-bit RGB).

Core Operations:

Resizing: Downscaling the image to a manageable size (e.g., 96x96 pixels) to reduce computation.

Color Space Conversion: Converting the image from RGB to Grayscale. This simplifies the math and is often sufficient for texture-based analysis. The formula Gray = 0.299*R + 0.587*G + 0.114*B involves multiplications and additions for every pixel.

Feature Extraction (Convolution): This is the computational core. We use small filters (kernels) to detect features like edges, spots, and textures.

Input: A 2D array of 8-bit grayscale pixel values.

Core Operation: A 2D Convolution. A 3x3 or 5x5 kernel matrix slides over the image. At each position, the corresponding pixel and kernel values are multiplied, and the results are summed up. This produces a single value for the output feature map. This process is repeated across the entire image. This is a massively parallel and intensely MAC-dominated workload.

Classification:

Input: The feature maps generated by the convolution step.

Core Operation: A simple classifier (like a decision tree) makes a final judgment. This involves a series of if-then-else comparisons on the feature values. This is heavy on branching and comparison instructions.

Conclusion: The workload is overwhelmingly dominated by 2D convolutions, which are pure MAC operations on 8-bit pixel data.

3. Module: Simplified Biometric Identification (Fingerprint)
Domain Analysis (The "Why")
Secure identity is the bedrock of a modern digital economy. In Lesotho, where formal identification can be a hurdle, biometrics provide a powerful solution for services like:

Mobile Money: Securely authorizing an M-Pesa transaction with a fingerprint instead of a vulnerable PIN.

Social Grants: Ensuring government pension or aid payments go to the correct person.

Healthcare: Accessing personal health records at a local clinic.

This module provides a secure, offline method to verify a user's identity.

Workload Requirements (The "How")
The core task is to extract unique features from a fingerprint image and match them against a stored template.

Image Enhancement:

Input: A grayscale fingerprint image.

Core Operations: Use filters to remove noise and enhance the contrast between ridges and valleys. This uses the exact same 2D Convolution (MAC) workload as the agricultural module.

Feature Extraction (Minutiae Detection):

Input: The enhanced image.

Core Operations: The goal is to find "minutiae" (ridge endings and splits). This is achieved by analyzing the 3x3 neighborhood of each pixel. This analysis often uses convolutional kernels designed to spot these specific patterns. The workload is, once again, dominated by MAC operations.

Template Matching:

Input: The list of extracted minutiae points (x, y, angle).

Core Operations: Compare the input list with a stored template. This involves calculating the Sum of Absolute Differences (SAD) between feature descriptors or point locations. This workload consists of loops performing subtraction, absolute value, and accumulation.

Conclusion: The critical feature extraction stage of fingerprint analysis shares the same MAC-intensive convolution workload as the agricultural module. The final matching stage introduces a similar but distinct "accumulate-after-operation" pattern
